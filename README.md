# Machine Learning Nanodegree

This a repo containing all my completed projects for Udacity's ML Nanodegree. If you would like to learn more about the program feel free to contact me or visithttps://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t

## Projects
1. Titanic Survival Exploration
	- Used Pandas and NumPy to explore and pre-process the dataset
	- Used scikit-learn to create a Decision Tree model and measure it's accuracy in determining survival of a passenger
	- Achieved 93% accuracy with custom hyperparameters
2. Predicting Boston Housing Prices
	- Used NumPy and Pandas to investigate important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset
	- Used scikit-learn to split data using Shuffle Split, train a Decision Tree Regressor, and obtain optimal hyperparameters using Grid Search.
	- Evaluated and Analyzed model performance using learning and complexity curves
