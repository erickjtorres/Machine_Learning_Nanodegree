# Machine Learning Nanodegree

This a repo containing all my completed projects for Udacity's ML Nanodegree. If you would like to learn more about the program feel free to contact me or visithttps://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t

## Projects
1. Titanic Survival Exploration
	- Used pandas and numpy to explore and pre-process the dataset
	- Used scikit-learn to create a Decision Tree model and measure it's accuracy in determining survival of a passenger
	- Achieved 93% accuracy with custom hyperparameters

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Tensorflow
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib
