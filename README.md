# Machine Learning Nanodegree

This a repo containing all my completed projects for Udacity's ML Nanodegree. If you would like to learn more about the program feel free to contact me or visithttps://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t

## Projects
1. Titanic Survival Exploration
	- Used Pandas and NumPy to explore and pre-process the dataset
	- Used scikit-learn to create a Decision Tree model and measure it's accuracy in determining survival of a passenger
	- Achieved 93% accuracy with custom hyper-parameters
2. Predicting Boston Housing Prices
	- Used NumPy and Pandas to investigate important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset
	- Used scikit-learn to split data using Shuffle Split, train a Decision Tree Regressor, and obtain optimal hyper-parameters using Grid Search.
	- Evaluated and Analyzed model performance using learning and complexity curves
3. Finding Donors for Charity ML
	- Identified when preprocessing was needed and applied it using pandas
	- Established a benchmark for Logistic Regression
	- Investigated candidate solutions between Logistic Regression, Bagging Classifier, and KNN algorithm
	- Extracted important features and achieved an accuracy score of 84% using Logistic Regression
4. Identifying Customers by Clustering Them
	- Applied preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
	- Interpreted data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
	- Analyzed PCA dimensions and constructed a new feature space.
	- Optimally clustered a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
